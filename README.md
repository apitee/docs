IaC solution multiplatform, can provide services based on kubernetes/gitlab/docker in automated way.

After you write the operation scenario as an yaml script can be easly runned and updated to share the flow for another user.

It's an opened standard for DSL and DEpendency Definition creating for automation and AI/ML integration on any environment with any techstack.


## backgrund

Today many automation staff on gitlab is not working from the scrach, 
You need to configure, and that is the task for APITEE solution.
We care for sharing the operations know how in a secure way with modular and reusable documented way with option to use just selected part.

Many operations can be automated by scripts in language like python, bash, lua.
Just we need somethin more flexible and opened to use everything what is native working on the OS shell.
The scenario is using shell client to do each work by early written script or by using ready to use solutions,
even some script can by generated by sentence dynamicly over ML/AI or can by used from secure marketplace.


## Secure

+ private variables
+ passwords
+ credentials
+ api keys
+ rights
+ roles

are not depends the script, sensitive data remains in the script-independent secure handling layer
as an browser pocket store for passwords and is sharing just data selected to the script in the environment like:
+ gitlab pipeline
+ docker environment
+ private user environment
+ kubernetes cluster
+ ....

## Usage

+ integration for browser, shell, email client
+ integration many platform based on shell/browser client
+ automation for cloud, embedded, edge infrastructure

## Editing

+ Text editor for yaml
+ IDE with APITEE plugin with validation and hints
+ UI in Browser, simple app based on lua: apitee browser
+ shell commands: apitee init


## Why yaml

The yaml give a benefit to create multilanguage layer with the way to use line by line commands in shell
The structure is offering grammatics for building the correct sentences with validation


## Start

Without params:
```bash
lua apitee.lua
```

Result:
```shell
git.yaml
test.yaml
```


with file and extension
```bash
lua apitee.lua git.yaml
```


without extension
```bash
lua apitee.lua git
```


with sentence to run selected line:
```bash
lua apitee.lua RUN HOST client 1
```



## Schema

### types

+ as yaml doc structure
